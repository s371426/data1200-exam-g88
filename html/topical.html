    <h1>Data 1100 - The Interplay between Technology and Society</h1>
    <div class="jajaja">
    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>Today the global infrastructure of the internet is, to a large degree, dependent on physical sub-sea and underground cables.
        Despite the global nature of the internet, the very fact that it relies on physical cables makes its flow of information
        sometimes subject to national borders. One recent example of this is the new Norwegian E-Law (2020),
        which propose that the intelligence service can monitor and collect all data that goes across the national border.</p>

    <p> As society becomes increasingly digitalized, internet cables can also be seen as critical infrastructure.
        Internet cables, both in the North-Sea and of the coast of Taiwan is suspected to have been deliberately sabotaged.</p>

    <p>An estimated 2,5 billion people in the world do not yet have access to the internet. To overcome the physical
        limitations of internet cables, companies like Starlink and the EU are working on providing internet access
        through satellites. Elon Musk’s Starlink is today the largest global provider of satellite internet with over
        4,500 satellites in orbit. They expect to have 42,000 new ones in orbit in the coming years.</p>

    <p><strong>Case</strong></p>
    <p>Imagine that you are part of a group of experts in computer technology that have been given the task of exploring
        what the potential impact of satellite internet technology might have on society. Your discussions can include its
        effects on national security, privacy, and everyday life. You could also discuss how the internet compares to other
        critical infrastructure like the electrical power grid, the sewage system or public roads. Include external sources
        when necessary. How is the internet connected to other infrastructures?</p>

    <h2>Key terms:</h2>
        <p>Critical infrastructure - systems that provide functions necessary for life.</p>
        <p>Technological trajectory – the evolution of technology in a specific field.</p>
        <p>Co-production – when experts from different fields work together to produce new technologies.</p>

        <h2>Identify the Situation:</h2>
        <p>My future job is likely to be heavily influenced by the internet. Considering that important information can be
            stolen online, one must be cautious. However, it’s also great that those parts of the world without internet
            access are also going to get connected, so we can send crucial messages everywhere in the world.
            And through the internet, every country will have the opportunity to develop both technologically
            and economically.</p>

        <h2>Describe your immediate reactions:</h2>
        <p>Satellites have made it easier to communicate across geographical boundaries.
            - Education has been made easier thanks to satellite technology and so more people are able to get an education than before.
            - They have also made it easy to establish communication links with remote and isolated regions all over the world.
            - Satellites allow for real time transmission of events so that people can witness world events as they are happening.
            - Satellites, however, cause pollution by contributing to space debris, and these debris can be dangerous
            if they end up colliding with other satellites.
        </p>

        <h2>Describe three potentially positive aspects of this development:</h2>
        <p>Satellite internet is now globally spread and gives us good access to others very quickly. It has become so widespread
            that it doesn't matter where you are in the world, even the least developed countries have access to it. We get most
            of our information and research form satellite internet, such as information from other countries that might have
            problems or are in wars. This gives us the opportunity to help others. This helps us to get further with our research
            and discover more. It´s also relatively cheap which makes it even more accessible for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Describe three potentially negative aspects of this development:</h2>
        <p>There are negative consequences of this technology. Such technology can invade the private lives of others.
            Information sent over the internet can be stolen and end up in the wrong hands. The expansion of the internet
            is harmful to the environment as well. Mostly servers must run 24/7 consuming a lot of energy. Technology is
            advancing fast, and we need new devices. This is also contributing to more electronic waste. The production
            of these devices isn’t so environmentally friendly. And the internet also leads to the spreading of false information.</p>

        <h2>Identify potential consequences:</h2>
        <p>The potential consequences that will derive from satellite technology Internet could be both positive and negative.
            Satellite technology would foremost be a huge benefit for those who live in poor or underserved areas, that don’t have
            access to the infrastructure needed for high-speed internet connection. Economically, global
            internet satellites would drive economic growth and increase opportunities in new areas who have not had prior access
            to this kind of technology. It would also lead to more competition in the market, reducing costs, but with a wide-scale
            implementation of satellite technology, we could potentially see the loss of traditional ISPs that would be replaced
            with the new technology, which would lead to job losses. Some are also sceptic to this technology, because of the
            privacy concerns that the government can use satellite data to monitor over unaware citizens without their consent.
            Some unintended consequences can be the space waste and radiation these satellites can emit.</p>
