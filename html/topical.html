    <h1>Data 1100 - The Interplay between Technology and Society</h1>
    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>Today the global infrastructure of the internet is, to a large degree, dependent on physical sub-sea and underground cables.
        Despite the global nature of the internet, the very fact that it relies on physical cables makes its flow of information
        sometimes subject to national borders. One recent example of this is the new Norwegian E-Law (2020),
        which propose that the intelligence service can monitor and collect all data that goes across the national border.</p>

    <p> As society becomes increasingly digitalized, internet cables can also be seen as critical infrastructure.
        Internet cables, both in the North-Sea and of the coast of Taiwan is suspected to have been deliberately sabotaged.</p>

    <p>An estimated 2,5 billion people in the world do not yet have access to the internet. To overcome the physical
        limitations of internet cables, companies like Starlink and the EU are working on providing internet access
        through satellites. Elon Musk’s Starlink is today the largest global provider of satellite internet with over
        4,500 satellites in orbit. They expect to have 42,000 new ones in orbit in the coming years.</p>

    <p><strong>Case</strong></p>
    <p>Imagine that you are part of a group of experts in computer technology that have been given the task of exploring
        what the potential impact of satellite internet technology might have on society. Your discussions can include its
        effects on national security, privacy, and everyday life. You could also discuss how the internet compares to other
        critical infrastructure like the electrical power grid, the sewage system or public roads. Include external sources
        when necessary. How is the internet connected to other infrastructures?</p>

    <h2> Discuss what is really the situation. How is this case related to society
        and technology, and your future profession?  </h2>
